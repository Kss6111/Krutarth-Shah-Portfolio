# Final Project ‚Äì Part I  
## The Rise of Consumer Debt in India  

---

## Outline

---

## High-Level Summary  
This project will explore the rise of small consumer debt in India, focusing on how everyday lifestyle purchases, such as clothing, electronics, and travel, are increasingly financed through credit cards, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) schemes, and EMI options.  

Over the past decade, India has witnessed rapid growth in unsecured consumer credit, particularly among younger, urban populations. This reflects shifting aspirations, the expansion of digital lending platforms, and a cultural shift toward financing consumption rather than only assets.  

The goal is to create a data-driven narrative that shows:  
- How consumer debt has grown in India  
- Which categories are most affected  
- How demographics (age, income) drive the trend  
- What the broader implications are for household financial health and the economy  

---

## Project Structure  

### 1. Consumer Debt Growth Over Time  
India‚Äôs household debt-to-GDP has risen to ~43% in 2024, with credit card outstanding balances growing at double-digit rates annually (RBI, 2024). BNPL loan volumes reached ~$14 billion in 2023, up from $11.6 billion in 2022 (IMARC, 2024).  

**Summary:** Highlights the rapid growth of small-ticket consumer credit. Policymakers can assess regulatory risks, businesses can gauge opportunities in digital lending, and consumers can understand how quickly credit has become mainstream.  

---

### 2. Assets vs. Non-Asset Borrowing  
About 30% of household debt in India is in housing, 10% in vehicles, while the share of loans taken for consumption (personal loans, credit cards, BNPL) has increased by ~5 percentage points in recent years (RBI FSR, 2024).  

**Summary:** Explores how debt is shifting away from long-term asset creation to short-term consumption. Policymakers can monitor systemic risks, businesses can identify growth categories like electronics and apparel, and households can reflect on financial sustainability.  

---

### 3. Household Budgets and Debt Servicing  
Indian households now allocate ~33% of monthly income to EMI repayments; among affluent groups, this can reach 45% (Economic Times, 2025). Meanwhile, the net household financial savings rate has fallen to ~5% of GDP, the lowest in decades (RBI, 2024).  

**Summary:** Illustrates how rising debt burdens affect financial resilience. Policymakers can track vulnerability to shocks, businesses can anticipate changes in spending behavior, and consumers can weigh the trade-off between borrowing and saving.  

---

### 4. Demographic Drivers of Credit Adoption  
Millennials and Gen Z are driving credit growth, especially in urban India. CIBIL data shows young consumers are early adopters of credit cards and BNPL, with average balances rising year-over-year (CIBIL, 2024).  

**Summary:** Highlights the role of younger demographics in fueling the credit boom. Policymakers can design financial literacy campaigns, businesses can tailor lending products, and young consumers can understand their long-term debt risks.  

---

### 5. Global Comparison of Household Debt  
India‚Äôs household debt-to-GDP (~43%) is lower than China (~61%) and far below advanced economies like the US and UK (80‚Äì100%+), but India‚Äôs non-mortgage debt levels are relatively high (BIS, 2024). Debt-service ratios in India are ~11%, compared to ~18% in China and ~8‚Äì10% in the US (BIS, 2024).  

**Summary:** Situates India globally, showing it is still a ‚Äúlow-debt‚Äù country overall but with unique vulnerabilities due to its rising consumer credit segment. Policymakers can benchmark resilience, businesses can assess India‚Äôs lending market maturity, and academics can compare India‚Äôs debt evolution with peers.  

---

### 6. Risks and Emerging Challenges  
Credit card delinquency rates rose to ~1.8% in June 2024, up from 1.6% a year earlier (CIBIL, 2024). With more households borrowing for discretionary items, repayment risks and financial stress are increasing.  

**Summary:** Examines risks of rising defaults, falling savings, and over-leverage. Policymakers can anticipate financial stability concerns, businesses can prepare for tighter regulations, and consumers can recognize the potential pitfalls of debt dependence.  

---

### 7. Conclusion / Call to Action  
India‚Äôs consumer debt growth is both a story of empowerment and risk. While credit expansion supports lifestyle aspirations, it also challenges household savings and financial resilience.  

**Summary:** Provides a roadmap for responsible credit growth. Policymakers can balance innovation with safeguards, businesses can expand lending responsibly, and consumers can adopt healthier borrowing practices.
