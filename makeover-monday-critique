# Critique and Redesign (MakeoverMonday)

## Why I Selected This Visualization
I chose this visualization because I’m personally interested in both fitness and nutrition, and I wanted to explore how data can be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of protein sources. Protein is one of the most important nutrients for building and maintaining muscle, but it can also get expensive depending on the source. I felt this visualization was a great opportunity to practice critiquing a real-world chart that connects with my own interests, and to see how I could make the information easier to understand for people who might be making everyday food choices.

## Step-by-Step Narrative

### Step 1: Critique
I started by critiquing the original visualization using **Stephen Few’s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile**. The chart was informative, but I noticed issues like unclear grouping, lack of strong visual hierarchy, and difficulty in quickly comparing cost-effectiveness across food types.  

### Step 2: Sketch
Based on the critique, I designed a redesign idea that grouped food categories more clearly and used colors to distinguish between vegetarian, vegan, and non-vegetarian options.  


### Step 3: Feedback
I shared my first draft with peers. My design had three distinct colors (light green for vegetarian, dark green for vegan, and dark gray for non-vegetarian). The feedback was helpful:  
- Too much eye travel.  
- No median line for comparison.  
- Vegan viewers would find other categories distracting.  

### Step 4: Redesign
Taking this feedback, I redesigned the visualization. I reduced the color complexity, added a **median line**, and focused the design to make it clearer for different dietary audiences.

## Reflection
This exercise taught me how much value comes from **iterative design and feedback**. My initial chart was visually clear to me, but once others looked at it, they pointed out things I had overlooked—like the need for a benchmark (median line) and the way color choices can cause distraction. By incorporating this feedback, my final design became much more effective and user-friendly. It reminded me that data visualization isn’t just about making something look good, but about **making it intuitive and useful for the audience**.

## AI Disclosure
I used Copilot (AI assistance) to help me navigate through Tableau and help me with formulas, rewrite parts of my write-up, specifically in structuring my narrative, polishing the language, and ensuring clarity. All data analysis, visualization design, and final decisions about the redesign were made by me.
